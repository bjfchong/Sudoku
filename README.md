# Sudoku

This is a program that I have written that solves sudokus. The sudoku is inputted by the text file Sudoku.txt, as 81 numbers with no other formatting and 0's in the empty spaces.

After being compiled to produce a class file, when this program is run it will search for the textfile Sudoku.txt in the same folder as the class file and will display the fully solved sudoku in the terminal.
